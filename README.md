### Known issues

- It's not very secure as it's actually a static site ran with firebase database and subscribing to the values in the db
- This means users could pontentially cheat values
- But there are currently no plans to move this to a SSR site to improve that issue. It's not an issue with high priority, because the easiest method to cheat is to just open wikipedia on a seperate page anyway
